# Survey Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks.
**NOTE**: This is still a work in progress.
Implementation of (GAINs)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02920] for use in survey data and/or
data sets comprised of only categorical varibles. All the experiments are inside the jupyter notebook
available in this repository. There is button at the top of the notebook to open it on Colab. We 
recomend doing this to leverage the free GPU available at Google Colab.

Our implementation is based on:
